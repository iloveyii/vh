Vh Script
=======
This a small and simple script to automate the manual work of creating virtual host in apache2. It has been developed and tested on Ubuntu.


## Setup 

  * First clone the repository.
  * Then run composer command `composer dump-autoload`.
  * Create a database (manually for now) and adjust the database credentials in the `config/app.php` file as per your environment.
  * Run the init command to create the database table as `php init.php`.

For more information about using Composer please see its [documentation](http://getcomposer.org/doc/).

## How to use the script

This framework is very easy to be used. You can create an object of the router by passing a request object to it as shown below.
